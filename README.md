# Hossam Hamdy's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This site is a space where I share my experiments, thoughts, and learnings about software development and technology.

>  Experimenting & Sharing - "Sharing is caring"

## About the Site

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme. It's designed to be minimal, responsive, and optimized for technical writing.
